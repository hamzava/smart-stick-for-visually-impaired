## üìñ Overview
Visually impaired individuals face difficulties in movement due to loss of visual acuity or reduced field of view.  
The **Smart Stick** aims to partially overcome this challenge by integrating modern electronics into a traditional navigation tool.  

Key features include:
- **Obstacle detection** using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Emergency SOS system** with GPS and GSM modules to send location data to a predefined contact.
- **Lightweight and practical design**, based on Arduino Nano with ATmega328 microcontroller.
